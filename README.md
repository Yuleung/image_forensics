    This repository is the code of the paper:  "No one can escape: A general approach to detect tampered and generated image"
    we propose a method that can detect both tampered images and GANs generated images with a high macro average of F1 score of 0.9865. In     addition, our model has strong generalization performance to a variety of GANs models in detection (the model is trained on the           datasets generated by BigGANs and can detect the images generated by a variety of other GANs models).
